# flowers-classification (Deep Learning Project: ANN & CNN)


This project demonstrates the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from start to finish.

## Project Workflow:
## Data Collection:
Downloaded organized data from the internet for training and testing.

## Data Preprocessing:
Prepared the dataset for modeling by ensuring proper formatting and cleaning.

## Model Building:
Developed a deep learning model using ANN and CNN architectures.
Initial testing revealed overfitting issues.

## Problem Resolution:
Applied Data Augmentation techniques such as:

Zoom
Rotate
These methods improved model generalization by handling diverse data scenarios.
Performance Enhancement:
After incorporating data augmentation, the model's testing accuracy improved significantly.
